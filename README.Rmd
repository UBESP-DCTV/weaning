This project uses the template for the analyses conducted  within the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence from the Medical  Sciences (LAIMS) at the Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Public health (UBEP) within the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic, Vascular Sciences, and Public Health (DSCTVPH) of the University of Padova (UniPD). The aim is to provide a ready-to-use robust, reproducible infrastructure for complex to quick analyses.

The goal of project is to explore continuous artificial ventilation data of ~180 patients to better understand how they can be used to predicti weaning success or failure in the Intensive Care Unit. DATA are not public, please contact lead author if you need to access the,

Main output will be:

- a series of exploratory reports
- a predictive model of weaning failure / success
- ...others to be determined

If you want to contribute in the project, in the `dev/` folder, you will find also the `02-dev_cycle.R` and the `03-run_cycle.R` helping you across the development and execution/update of the project.

## Functionalities

- A dedicated packages' **project-level library** powered by `{renv}`
- All the **documentation** for functions and the project itself powered by `{roxygen2}`
- A **test-driven environment** powered by `{testthat}`, `{checkmate}`, and `{covr}` including an addin for continuous monitoring of codes and tests changes, automatically triggering tests as needed, powered by `{CorradoLanera/autotestthat}`.
- Systems for grammar and static code checking powered by `{spelling}` and `{lintr}`, respectively
- Continuous Integration and Development is activated and powered by GitHub actions, automating linters and checks execution, and coverage assessment.
- A full environment enforcing reproducibility by the execution, caching and invalidation of a structured project's pipeline powered by `{targets}` and `{tarchetypes}` in conjunction and synergy with Rmarkdown scientifically flavored documents powered by `{distill}` (with options for connections with Zotero as citation manager, linked with local or remote libraries)
